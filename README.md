# challenge-my-ts-knowledge
A collection of interactive challenges that brings your TypeScript knowledge to the next level!

## Note to the warrior

So you decided to step in this way. Any challenge you face, possibly has many solutions. All you need is curiosity and questioning. Feel free to talk to your neighbor/mate.

## How to set up

Clone and install all the dependencies:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sorousht/challenge-my-ts-knowledge.git
$ npm i
```

Find all occurrences of `FIXME` in the code. There you need to adjust the code. To find out if your solution fits, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

Once you found all tests passed, move on to the next challenge:

```bash
$ npm run next
```

In case, if you need to checkout something in the previous challenge, try:

```bash
$ npm run previous
```
