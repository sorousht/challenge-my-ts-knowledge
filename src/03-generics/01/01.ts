  Below, you will find a simple function that returns value of
  a given property of an object, implemented in JavaScript!

  We just need a bit of typing on top to compile the code.
  Hint: Remember the name of this module :)

  // Nothing is wrong with the implementation, just that simple!
  return obj[prop];
