You have not been asked to check the content of this file,
but you are curious and you will be rewarded by a valuable tip!

To check against either null or "undefined", double equal "==" can be used.
As an example, the below condition is met, when the value of "foo" is neither "null" nor "undefined".

```js
if (foo == undefined) {
  console.log('worked!');
}
```

TypeScript has a utility type for this purpose: NonNullable<T>
