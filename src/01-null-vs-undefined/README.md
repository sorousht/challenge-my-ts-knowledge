## undefined vs. null

You need a warm up first. As you noticed by reading the title, in the first challenge you learn something that is always confusing. Although those can be used interchangeably, they do not mean the same.

> **undefined** is designed to present something that has not been initialized.
> **null** means something is unavailable.


Write down the answers after tackling the challenge:

1. What does this function return?

```ts
function foo(): void {}
```

2. When should we prefer `null` over `undefined`?
